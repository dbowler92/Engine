//VulkanRenderCommandBuffer.h
//Created 21/04/17
//Created by Daniel Bowler
//
//Represents the vulkan command buffer that will be sent to 
//the GPU for processing. Create one of these by calling command 
//buffer pool functions rather than creating (new) one manually. 
//
//NOTE: 27/04/17 -> Currently, this is depreciated. VulkanCommandBufferPool will alloc and return
//VkCommandBuffer(s) directly -> This avoids a (currently... I'm not going to delete
//this class just incase I change my mind!) needless GE_NEW to alloc a new RenderCommandBuffer
//which simply wraps the VkCommandBuffer. Given that these buffers maybe allocated a lot 
//at runtime, this seems like a bad idea. Some of the functionality provided here has been
//moved off to a more general VulkanStatics class for now!
